# 自我介绍

### 中文：

我叫张紫琳，19软件工程专业。面试前端开发岗位。我想一下几个方面介绍自己。

（1）首先从学习方面，我在大二下学期就已经获得英语四级证书。在大二决定自己选择前端开发方向后，开始自学html、css、javascript。大三开始自学Vue、Ajax等技术，并配合Element-ui进行开发静态页面。

（2）其次在项目经验方面来说，我大二下学期跟随师兄参加计算机设计大赛，我主要负责文档编写、PPT制作、界面ui设计以及使用vue和element-ui进行静态页面开发，并使用GIT、Sourcetree和github进行协同合作，学会了在github和gitee上面部署项目。

（3）之后，在暑假期间，参加了数学建模，获得了省级二等奖。这个比赛对我的算法能力以及耐心的锻炼来说具有很大帮助。

（4）后来一起组队参加小程序竞赛，我主要负责前端页面开发以及接口的调试，主要选择将图片信息存储到阿里OSS云存储。在这期间也研究了githubpages、uni-app等一些有关的技术，学会了使用域名和二级域名连接github项目，使得外网可以访问项目。我学习uni-app的时候，同时学会了bootstrap和使用媒体查询进行页面响应式开发。

最后，从我的未来规划上来说，我希望能够通过实习，锻炼好实践能力，提高学习能力、抗压能力。

### 英文：

My name is Zhang Zilin, you can call me Alyn, 19 software engineering major. Interview for a front-end development position. I'd like to introduce myself in several aspects.
(1) First of all, in terms of learning, I have already obtained the CET-4 certificate in the second semester of my sophomore year. After the sophomore decided to choose the front-end development direction, I learned HTML, CSS, and javascript by myself. In my junior year, I began to learn Vue,  Ajax, and other technologies by myself, and developed static pages with Element UI.
(2) Secondly, in terms of project experience, I participated in a computer design competition with my senior brother in the second semester of my sophomore year. I was mainly responsible for document writing, PPT production, UI design, and static page development using Vue and element UI. I also used GIT, Sourcetree, and GitHub to collaborate, and learned to deploy projects on GitHub and the site.
(3) Later, during the summer vacation, I participated in mathematical modeling and won the provincial second prize. This competition is beneficial for my algorithm ability and patience training.
(4) Later, I formed a team to participate in the applet competition. I was mainly responsible for front-end page development and interface debugging. I mainly chose to store image information in Alibaba OSS cloud storage. During this period, I also studied GitHub pages, uni app, and other related technologies, and learned to use domain names and secondary domain names to connect GitHub projects, so that external networks can access projects. When I learned about the uni app,  I also learned about page responsive development using media queries and Bootstrap.
Finally, from the perspective of my future planning, I hope to improve my practice, learning, and anti-pressure ability through an internship.
